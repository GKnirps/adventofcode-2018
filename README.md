Advent of Code 2018
===================

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).
All solutions so far have been written in rust.

Some of the days don't have a solution yet, even though it looks like it (day 15 and day 23).

The commit and merge history is a bit weird because originally I had one repository for each day and I merged them together.
